# Ramble (Django Chat App)

## Description and Motivation:
- Ramble is a chat application that will allow users to conversate or "ramble" to mutiple users!
- Our motivation of picking this topic is bringing back the memories that apps such as "Kik" or "Omegle" as well as most recent used apps such as "Discord" or "Slack" has brought to our users. Also, we believe that this app will be suitable to create interactions during this pandemic.

## Pior Art: 
- We took inspiration from previous big name chat app such as "Kik", "Omegle", "Discord", and "Slack". 

## User Workplace 
- Will have the user make the choice of either signing in or signing up.
- Will have the user fill in the information that include their username, email, and password to create an account.
- Once signed in, the user will be able to create, join, or continue in a variety of chat rooms.
- The user will be able to see if the people in the conversation are online or offline, like similiar chat apps.
- The user will be notified if the members of the chat room are typing. 
- In the chat room, the user will have the options to voice message with them as long as view the users' profile.
- While viewing a different user's profile, you will have an option to block or report them if they are using the app to harm other users.
